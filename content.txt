ANNOUNCEMENT

The Feminist Theory Series üìö kicks-off again on September 25th, and this time there is a twist! In a continuing effort to build feminist community here on the stacks, I have invited a handful of my favorite feminist writers ‚ú® to join us as special guest-participants.

Each special guest has chosen for us an essay or book chapter in their area of interest ‚Äî a piece that inspires them to want to share with others and discuss. We'll be reading texts across many disciplines: film theory, art history, history history, philosophy, and more! üëÄ
